Gather Information is one of the main features, playing the INPUT role of the whole system.\
Gather Information is defined as the step of gathering, downloading, converting any outside-of-system information and data into the system.

TODO: copy the introduction from index.md

The three main questions we need to answer are listed as following:

1. Where to gather
2. What to gather
3. How to gather

## Where to Gather

There is a big difference since the Internet emerged,
In the past days, we can only gather information from real world -- newspaper, word of mouth, travel ... \
But nowadays, you can gather information without the limitation of time and space, which is why information explotion like this.

So, information/data are everywhere, and they can be represented in various ways. 

Considering this system is a system building on morden computer, all data/information can be represented/stored as:

1. Character
2. Image
3. Audio
4. Video
5. Chart

The questions information sources need to figured out is:

1. what is a source
2. what is an item

Here we divided source into these types based on where are they from.

### From the Virtual Life

The virtual life is reffering to the world/life that the world people built as the mirror of the real world. \
*TODO: weried, maybe wrong*

1. [From Native App](./where/virtual-life/native-app.md)
2. [From Web](./where/virtual-life/web.md)
3. [From RSS](./where/virtual-life/rss.md)
4. [From Email](./where/virtual-life/email.md)
5. [From SMS](./where/virtual-life/sms.md)

### From the Real Life

1. Magazine
2. Newspaper
3. Word of Mouth
4. Camera
5. Brain (Thought, things you see)
6. Books
7. Notes

## What to Gather

You might say, just grab all things down, make sure the information is complete and correct. \
That's right, in the stage of gathering, we should foucs on Complete and Correct.

But based on different types of information/data and various sources, they should have their own \
specialized answer of "What to Gather".

Instead of discussing one by one, we can abstract some commonalities from them. \
These are mostly the case/need.

1. All
2. Manual Selected
3. Auto Selected

## How to Gather

It's the question about the time, method of gathering, it also need to be specialized.

Every source has different method to gather, techniqually and physically. \
Such as we can use things like Memos/Flow to gather our thoughts, use RSSReader to gather information from RSS ...

Whatever the source is, they have a minium unit, we named it Item. (TODO, not a good name)
