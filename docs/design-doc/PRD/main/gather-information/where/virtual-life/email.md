# Information Source - Email

Email plays a significant role in work, communication and subscription ...

We will discuss email from the perspective of content type or usage.

## By Sender

Whatever the content is, an email has a sender. \
Therefore, we should consider a sender (a group of sender) as a source. \
All the emails from these sender(s) will be gathered together.

Every email should be considered as an item, for instance, Newsletter.

### eg. Newsletter

Newsletter is the content you subscribed through Email.

Normally, you subscribed them subjectively, such as xxx Weekly, Blog Subscription ... \
But some of them are subscribed to you when you sign up an account that you not noticed.

Anyway, newsletter, every letter should be seen as an item since it's separated in time and have no relations between \
the last one and the after one.

But it does not suit every case. \
What if you have an conversation in email, a non-single-usage sender or what ...

## By Reply

Gather a conversation based on reply relationship, every reply refresh the item since the newest mail has the complete record.

TODO: need more investigation, what if a group discussion ?

## By Manual

For example, your manager might send you work agendas while also doing conversation or other things through one email address. \
In this case, what source the mail belongs to is based on its content. \
And in the most of case, only a few of this kind of mails are valueable/need to be gathered. \

So it's better to delegate the user or user's agenet to classify it, put into the correspoding customized/preseted sources.

## Other things

From Email type of source, only a complete email can be seen as an item. \
Selection, part of the mail shouldn't be recognized as an item and \
shouldn't be gathered from Email source.
