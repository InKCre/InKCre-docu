Basically, there's only one word:

> Solve series of problems on the path from information to creation.

And this path can be mainly divided into these stages. \
PS: It's not a linear path or sequence.

## Gather Information

Or we should call it the **INPUT** of the whole system.

As distributed, standalone system are not friendly when we need to output. \
Our system is designed to gather all stuff in one place. \
PS: Or at least you can access all these from one place.

For details, check [Gather Information](./gather-information/index.md)

## Process Information

You can call those information you collected from the INPUT 'data' or 'information'. \
But anyway, you are going to screen, read, extract it.

## Manage Information and Knowledge

After information processed, you need to organize, store them into the base you built. \
The aim of management is to use them someday.

## Use Information and Knowledge

When you have the need to use your base, whatever the aim is, the system shouldn't slow you down \
and should accelerate, assist you in practicle.
